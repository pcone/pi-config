# Pi Agent Configuration

Global configuration for [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) coding agent at `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.80.3`.

Symlinks in `~/.pi/agent/` point into this repo:

```bash
ln -sf ~/Developer/pi-config/APPEND_SYSTEM.md ~/.pi/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.md
ln -sf ~/Developer/pi-config/extensions ~/.pi/agent/extensions
ln -sf ~/Developer/pi-config/settings.json ~/.pi/agent/settings.json
ln -sf ~/Developer/pi-config/skills ~/.pi/agent/skills
ln -sf ~/Developer/pi-config/themes ~/.pi/agent/themes
ln -sf ~/Developer/pi-config/models.json ~/.pi/agent/models.json
ln -sf ~/Developer/pi-config/rules ~/.pi/agent/rules   # whole dir (first time: rm -rf the existing ~/.pi/agent/rules dir first)
```

## Structure

- `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` — Instructions appended to every system prompt (doc/decision/testing discipline, behavioral constraints, landing work, subagent guidance). **Placement rule:** repo-independent process rules live here; a project's own `AGENTS.md` carries only what is specific to that project (`decisions/settings/002`). See `extensions/append-system-local.ts` for an optional personal/local tail that is **not** committed.
- `settings.json` — Global settings (default provider/model, thinking level, extensions)
- `models.json` — Custom provider overrides — currently a single OpenRouter routing guard pinning the fleet model to DeepSeek's first-party endpoint (`deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash`, decision 022; previously the oracle's `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813` pin, decision 020). Max-token pins and vestigial routing entries were pruned 2026-08-28.
- `extensions/checkpoint.ts` — Archive-and-compact on demand; archives stored under `.pi/checkpoints/`
- `extensions/lib/pdf-convert.ts` — PDF detection, conversion (pymupdf4llm → pdftotext), temp-file helpers, and response builders shared by fetch-url and pdf-read-guard (plain module — under `lib/` so the extension loader's `*.ts` auto-discovery skips it)
- `extensions/lib/fleet-model.ts` — The fleet constants (`FLEET_PROVIDER`/`FLEET_MODEL` = `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash`): fallback for agents with no `model:` frontmatter and target of the compaction override. Shared by subagent-async and compaction (decision 022; the `/fleet-model` command and `~/.pi/fleet-model.json` override were deleted when the fleet went OpenRouter-only).
- `extensions/pdf-read-guard.ts` — Intercepts `read` on `.pdf` files; replaces raw binary content with converted Markdown (never raw bytes in context)
- `extensions/subagent-async/index.ts` — Non-blocking subagents via RPC mode: spawn, check progress (`/subagents`), steer, stop. Subagents fork from HEAD (not working tree) — commit first. Includes live log viewer (`/watch`), external viewer (`watch-session`). The printed session id is the subagent's real pi session id (spawned with `--session-id`), so it is searchable in `/resume` and joinable from a terminal via `pi --session <id>`. It is also the subagent's peer-link identity: every subagent heartbeats into the peer mailbox as `subagent-<id>`, so you can `peer_send` it a message (injected as a user message) and its reply comes back automatically. `PI_PEER_NAME` is always set to the session id — an inherited value would make sibling subagents collide on one mailbox identity. Children get the shared global prompt (`APPEND_SYSTEM.md`) explicitly via an extra `--append-system-prompt`, because passing the agent body suppresses pi's own append-system-prompt discovery (`decisions/subagents/025-global-append-for-subagents.md`).
- `extensions/subagent/` — (disabled) Original synchronous subagent extension, kept for reference.
- `extensions/footer-session-id.ts` — Replaces the footer with one that adds a themed, reversible identifier (e.g. `arcane-phoenix-archmage`) for the current session on the right side. The phrase is bijective with the first 4 hex chars of the UUID session ID — look up the words in the lists to recover the prefix. The full session UUID itself is also shown greyed-out to the left of the words (the only place the raw id appears in the footer; dropped first on narrow terminals). Each session also gets a per-session hue (derived from the same bits) and a staleness indicator (`●◐◌○`) that tracks time since the most recent entry — the words themselves fade along the same axis, so freshness reads at a glance.
- `extensions/session-name.ts` — Reverse lookup: resolves a friendly name back to a full session id (`session_by_name` tool, `/session-name <name>` command). The words encode only 18 of the UUID's 128 bits, so the name is a fingerprint, not an identity; when several sessions collide on one name and exactly one was active (last activity = file mtime) within the last 7 days it is assumed correct, otherwise the collision is surfaced — a list picker in TUI, the candidates as text elsewhere. Non-UUID ids (subagents/reviewers) all map to the sentinel `wandering-???-seeker` and resolve back through it.
- `extensions/modes.ts` — Toggles the parent session between `implement` (default — parent does work directly) and `orchestrate` (parent dispatches to subagents). Per-project state at `<cwd>/.pi/mode.json`. Commands: `/mode` toggles, `/mode <implement|orchestrate>` sets explicit. Footer shows current mode.
- `extensions/pinned-sessions.ts` — A curated, named shortlist of sessions you want to keep track of and relaunch easily, out of the noise of one-off sessions. Global registry at `~/.pi/pinned-sessions.json` (keyed by session-file path; each entry remembers its project so a pin resumes across projects after a reboot). Commands: `/pin [name]` pins the current session (name falls back to the session display name, then the first user-message excerpt; when given it also sets the session display name), `/unpin [query]` unpins the current session or a named match (tab-completes names), `/pinned` opens a list picker that resumes the selection. Dead session files are skipped. Startup-summary line included.
- `agents/implement.md` — Single implementation tier: `implement` on `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash:high` (all feature work routes here). Every seat runs the same model since 2026-10-01 (decision 022 — the z.ai subscription ended): reviewers `:high` (all three review seats are on MiMo V2.6 Flash — the review tier is Xiaomi-lab, decorrelated from the DeepSeek implementer; decision 023), scouts `:low`, orchestrator and oracle `:max`, compaction `:low` (effort audit: `:medium` silently clamped to high, and the only real discount tier is `low`); the `/fleet-model` toggle is gone. Single review tier since 2026-08-28 (the `-deep` reviewer agents were deleted).
- `extensions/append-system-local.ts` — Appends a second system-prompt fragment from `~/.pi/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.local.md` (a real file, **not** symlinked into this repo, so it never gets committed) directly after `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`. Optional and missing-file-safe — for personal/local nudges you want to experiment with without touching shared config. Cached by mtime, so edits apply live on the next agent run with no restart.
- `extensions/peer-link/` — Two user-launched pi sessions coordinate by exchanging user messages. Sessions sharing a mailbox (`~/.pi/peer-mail`, or `$PI_PEER_MAILBOX`) send each other messages; an inbound message is injected as a real user message (`[peer:<name>] …`) that triggers the receiving agent, and the response can auto-flow back once per message (`expectReply`). Loop-safe: envelopes are consumed on read, replies never re-forward. Identity: `$PI_PEER_NAME`, else the session display name (`--name`), else the session filename, else host-pid. Commands: `/peers`, `/peer-send [--reply] <name> <text>`, `/peer-autoreply [on|off]`. LLM tools: `peer_list`, `peer_send` (broadcast with `to: "*"`; unlisted names fail loud instead of queueing into an inbox nobody reads — call peer_list first; `requireOnline: true` fails loud for offline peers; listed-but-offline peers queue until their next scan). Tests: `tests/peer-link.test.ts` (unit + SDK integration), `tests/peer-link-smoke.ts` (two real processes).
- `extensions/bug-triage.ts` — Turns a session launched as `pi --name bug-triage` into the standing **bug-triage peer**: a long-running intake queue for bugs in `main` (ownership transfer, not delegation — each session still fixes its own WIP regressions). Injects `agents/bug-triage.md` into the system prompt + a one-shot kick-off; Non-triage sessions run no-op handlers (a name compare). Runs in its own clone (one-clone-per-session convention) — bisects, checks out commits, builds freely; trivial fixes clear the review gate, then merge to the mainline and push to `origin`. Reporters hand off via `peer_send("bug-triage", …)` (see APPEND_SYSTEM); the peer files a `gh issue` + failing `.cases` and pings back only if the finding affects the caller's in-flight work, or hands back if it reproduces only on the caller's branch. Launch: `pi --name bug-triage` in a second terminal, then `/pin bug-triage`. Why a peer not a 4th mode: see `decisions/bug-triage/001-bug-triage-peer.md`. Test: `tests/bug-triage.test.ts`.
- `skills/pdf` — On-demand PDF conversion (pymupdf4llm/pdftotext) for when automatic paths fail
- `skills/review-brief` — Review-brief format: per-feature briefs + batch index, ISO 24495-1 plain-language pass, chunked review units, fresh-reader comprehension gate
- `skills/work-order-template` — Work-order schema for delegating implementation tasks to subagents
- `rules/` — Global path-scoped rules, symlinked whole-dir into `~/.pi/agent/rules/` (mirrors the skills/extensions pattern). The whole dir is version-controlled here:
  - `writing-rules.md` — meta: how to write/format pi rules (fires on `.pi/rules/**/*.md`)
  - `re-litigation-proof.md` — write docs that settle their own "why" (fires on `decisions/**` + `docs/**`)
  - `work-order-numbering.md` — reserve-then-dispatch for sequential work-order ids across concurrent sessions, push as the collision detector (fires on `**/work-orders/**`)
- `themes/catppuccin-macchiato.json` — Color theme

## Extension temp data

fetch-url and kagi-search save large pages / search responses under `~/.pi/tmp/<extension>/` (72h TTL; this is NOT a cache — every call hits the network fresh). model-tiers still uses `~/.pi/cache/<extension>/` for benchmark data (24h TTL). All outside the repo (under HOME), so no `.gitignore` entries are needed; dirs are created on first write by the extension itself.

- `~/.pi/tmp/fetch-url/` — large fetched pages (HTML→Markdown); 72h TTL
- `~/.pi/tmp/pdf-convert/` — PDF conversions saved when too large to inline; 72h TTL
- `~/.pi/tmp/kagi-search/` — Kagi API search responses; 72h TTL
- `~/.pi/cache/model-tiers/` — OpenRouter benchmarks and model info; 24h TTL
- `~/.pi/peer-mail/` — peer-link mailbox: one subdir per peer for envelopes, `_peers/` for heartbeats (created on first use, 0700)

## Tools added

- **`subagent(agent, task, cwd?, inheritParentModel?, isolate?, carryUncommitted?, baseRef?, review_policy?, workOrderPath?, silenceTimeoutMs?)`** — Spawn an async subagent that runs in the background. Subagents fork from HEAD — commit any uncommitted work the subagent needs before delegating. `workOrderPath` makes the referenced work order's `review_policy` the single source of truth for the review gate (decision 014). `silenceTimeoutMs` auto-kills a child that makes no progress (no tool calls and no assistant messages) for that many milliseconds — default 30 min, `0`/negative disables the auto-kill (decision 015; the session stays resumable via `subagent_resume`). Use `/subagents` to check progress, `/watch <id>` for live output.
- **`subagent_status(session_id)`** — Check progress of a running async subagent
- **`subagent_steer(session_id, message)`** — Inject a steering message into a running subagent
- **`subagent_stop(session_id, final_message?)`** — Tell a running subagent to wrap up and return
- **`subagent_kill(session_id)`** — Hard-kill a stuck subagent by terminating its underlying `pi` process (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 5s). Use when `subagent_stop` cannot recover the child (RPC stdin not being read, deadlocked, infinite loop, blocked provider call). Result is delivered as a user message with a `[Killed via subagent_kill ...]` marker. Destructive — prefer `subagent_stop` when the subagent is responsive.
- **`checkpoint(summary, nextSteps?, continue?, newCwd?)`** — Archive the current session to `.pi/checkpoints/session-<timestamp>.jsonl`, override compaction with the supplied summary, optionally send a follow-up kickoff prompt. When `newCwd` is provided, fork to a fresh session in that directory instead of compacting: the archive is written, a new session file is created in the target cwd's session storage with the checkpoint summary as its initial context, and a `checkpoint_fork` entry is recorded on the old session.

## Not tracked

- `auth.json` — API keys (stored in macOS Keychain via `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`)
- `bin/` — Binary tools (rg, fd) — install separately
- `sessions/` — Session history
- `.pi/checkpoints/` — Per-project checkpoint archives
