# Structure trend

Chunk-boundary structural snapshot for this repo. Convention: `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`
§Structural audits at chunk boundaries and
`decisions/subagents/024-structural-growth-checks.md`. One entry per chunk
landing, newest first, under two lenses — **growth** (file/function size deltas,
candidate extractions) and **unification** (parallel mechanisms for one idea;
files unrelated work items all had to touch). Delta-based — no absolute
thresholds. Each audit runs as `scout-code` over the delta since the previous
entry; the ranked candidates feed the next chunk's sequence before feature work.

## 2026-10-08 — chunk: WO-2026-052 → decision 031 (`4cdce3b..16eb6fe`)

25 commits, 12 source files, **+2153/−314** lines (vendored code excluded;
`extensions/auto-checkpoint.ts` + its test excluded — another session's
uncommitted work). Measurements from git refs, spot-checked against `wc`/Node.
This is the baseline entry: there is no prior snapshot, so deltas are against
`4cdce3b` (the WO-2026-052 landing), not against a previous entry.

### Growth

Top 10 `.ts` files, current vs `4cdce3b` (`git show 4cdce3b:<path> | wc -l`):

| # | file | now | base | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `extensions/subagent-async/index.ts` | 4251 | 4039 | **+212** |
| 2 | `extensions/subagent-async/watch-session-v2.ts` | 1675 | 1675 | 0 |
| 3 | `extensions/footer-session-id.ts` | 1456 | 1456 | 0 |
| 4 | `tests/subagent-id-resolution.test.ts` | 769 | 492 | **+277** |
| 5 | `extensions/checkpoint.ts` | 726 | 726 | 0 |
| 6 | `tests/activity-timeline.test.ts` | 716 | 716 | 0 |
| 7 | `extensions/model-tiers/index.ts` | 707 | 704 | +3 |
| 8 | `tests/peer-link.test.ts` | 621 | 621 | 0 |
| 9 | `tests/e2e-checkpoint.test.ts` | 601 | 601 | 0 |
| 10 | `extensions/rules.ts` | 600 | 520 | +80 |

Growth concentrated in the repo's top-1 file (+212) and its largest test file
(+277). Also grew >100 below the top 10: `tests/model-tiers-render.test.ts`
156→427, plus new files `tests/subagent-model-inheritance.test.ts` (431),
`tests/rules-refresh.test.ts` (311), `tests/subagent-resume-cwd.test.ts` (208).
The three already-top-5 files that did not move (`watch-session-v2.ts`,
`footer-session-id.ts`, `checkpoint.ts`) carry large functions — 422 and 306
lines in the two unchanged extensions — but no delta risk.

Functions over ~150 lines in the files the delta touched (brace-matched):

| function | span | lines | changed by delta? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `subagent-async/index.ts` `export default function (pi)` | 3170–4251 | **1082** | yes — 13 hunks land inside it |
| `subagent-async/index.ts` `spawnSubagent` | 1724–2387 | **664** | yes — 3 hunks (model resolution, args, prompt) |
| `subagent-async/index.ts` `processLine` (nested in `spawnSubagent`) | 1973–2262 | 290 | no |

The largest function in the repo is a single 1082-line extension factory; the
delta added to it rather than through it.

**Duplication introduced or still present inside the delta:**
- `review_policy` is matched by three separate regexes — `parseWorkOrderPolicy`
  (`index.ts:1656-1661`), the task-text gate fallback (`index.ts:1823`), and the
  skip-injection detector (`index.ts:3422`, byte-identical to 1823). See
  Unification below.
- `createPiStub` exists in 6 test files, 3 of them added by this delta:
  `tests/subagent-id-resolution.test.ts:409`, `tests/subagent-resume-cwd.test.ts:154`,
  `tests/subagent-model-inheritance.test.ts:188`, plus pre-existing copies in
  `tests/subagent-async-kill.test.ts:203`, `tests/todo-injection.test.ts:47`,
  `tests/subagent-session-lifetime.test.ts:90`.
- `extensions/model-tiers/index.ts`: the missing-axis `mark` ternary at `:468`
  and `:512`, with the same `†` legend dimmed at `:480` and `:522`.

**De-duplication the delta itself performed** (the counter-trend): one
`findRunningByQuery` replaces two identical running-map loops; one
`resolveChildModel` replaces two `effectiveModel` computations; one
`describeUnknownSession` replaces four copies of the not-found string; one
`scoreRows` replaces `scoreModels`/`scoreAllModels`; one `applyFreeCutoff`
replaces two inline cutoffs. Removed dead code: `UPCOMING_OPEN_WEIGHTS`,
`contextTier`, `paretoFilter3D`. No dead code found in the delta.

**Churn** (commits per file in the delta, max 4 in the whole range):

| file | commits | work items |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/model-tiers-render.test.ts` | 4 | one (model-tiers rework) |
| `extensions/subagent-async/index.ts` | 3 | **three distinct** — `f864339` id resolution, `65bef12` resume cwd, `ed1c0a4` decision 031 |
| `extensions/model-tiers/index.ts` | 3 | one (model-tiers rework) |
| `tests/subagent-nesting.test.ts` | 2 | two (same 028 topic) |
| `extensions/rules.ts` | 2 | two — line cap, re-read at injection |

Only `subagent-async/index.ts` served unrelated work items (3) — and it is also
the top-1 largest file and the largest function's home. That is the boundary
smell this audit exists to catch.

### Unification

**`review_policy` has three parse sites and two accepted grammars.** The sites
answer different questions, but the task-text pair is a literal duplicate:

- `index.ts:1656` `parseWorkOrderPolicy` — accepts the canonical bullet
  `/^\s*-\s*\*\*review_policy\*\*:\s*(\S+)/m` **or** the YAML line
  `/^review_policy:\s*(\S+)/m`; first token `=== "skip"`.
- `index.ts:1823` gate fallback — `/^\s*-\s*\*\*review_policy\*\*:\s*skip\b/m`
  on the task text, only when no WO is present.
- `index.ts:3422` injection detector — the same regex, deciding whether the task
  already carries the skip bullet.

Measured behavior (Node, one encoding per row):

| input | parse (`:1658`) | gate (`:1823`) | inject-detect (`:3422`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `- **review_policy**: skip` | skip | true | true |
| `**review_policy**: skip` (no dash) | required | false | false |
| `review_policy: skip` (YAML) | **skip** | false | false |
| `- **review_policy**: required` | required | false | false |
| `- **review_policy**: required \| skip` | required | false | false |

The bare-bold row is a silent mis-read (a peer hit it in another repo: the WO
declared `skip`, the gate stayed live, and the tool param cannot override a
present WO by design — decision 014). The YAML row shows the gate and injection
sites do not accept the encoding the parser does; only the parser's first form
is mirrored by the task-text sites.

**Second implementation of the same logic:** `extensions/subagent-async/test-workorder-policy.cjs`
(302 lines) mirrors the parser (`:41`), the skip-bullet regex (`:49`), the gate
computation (`:56`) and the injector (`:70`) with `KEEP IN SYNC` contracts,
because plain `node` cannot import `index.ts` (typebox/`@earendil-works/*`
resolve only under jiti). It is a manual fixture (`node <file>`), referenced
only by WO-2026-033/035/037 as a required test boundary — no runner wires it in.
It is **already stale**: its parser has no YAML alternative, so it reads
`review_policy: skip` as `required` where production reads `skip`.

**Checked and not found duplicated** (recorded so the next audit does not redo
the search): model-spec splitting (`splitModelSpec` is the only
`lastIndexOf(":")` in `extensions/` + `apps/`); argv building
(`buildSubagentArgs`) and meta building (`buildSpawnMeta`); model resolution
(`resolveChildModel` is now the single source for both spawn args and
`meta.json`); resume validation (`validateResumeMeta`, module scope);
session-header reading (`readSessionCwd` is the only header-cwd parser —
`footer-session-id.ts` takes header/entries as arguments and `checkpoint.ts`
never parses a pi session header).

### Extraction candidates (ranked by lines-removed × risk)

| # | candidate | lines removed | risk | owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Extract the shared test `createPiStub` into one `tests/` helper, called from all 6 files | ~25 (3 delta copies), ~44 if the 3 pre-existing copies collapse too | low — test-only, no production blast radius | test-infra cleanup |
| 2 | Fold `test-workorder-policy.cjs`'s mirrored parser/gate/injector onto shared logic (or at minimum sync its YAML gap) | ~35 mirrored lines | medium — node-only harness by design, cross-file coupling, no automated runner | review-policy harness |
| 3 | One `review_policy` resolver for the three sites (shared bullet regex + a `hasSkipBullet` used by `:1823`/`:3422`), which is also the single place the bare-bold gap closes | 1–3 regex lines; closes a silent mis-read | low — `tests/work-order-policy.test.ts` covers the parser | subagent review-policy |
| 4 | One helper for the `model-tiers` `†` mark + legend at `:468/:480/:512/:522` | ~2–3 | low — pure render, covered by `tests/model-tiers-render.test.ts` | model-tiers render |

Candidate 3 is coupled to the pending owner ruling on the work-order grammar
(bare-bold acceptance); candidate 2 rides with it.

### Limits

Negative claims are scoped to the files searched: `apps/changelog-gen`,
`extensions/peer-link` and `watch-session-v2.ts` were not read for duplication
beyond the searches above. Candidate 1's spans and candidate 3's regex lines
were counted; candidates 2 and 4 are structural estimates from matched spans.
The working tree was not read (another session's WIP excluded by instruction).
